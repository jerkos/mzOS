# Some stuffs to do

* support more databases

* export results as a graph

* Test extensively

* include some other metric in the bayesian algorithm such as mass default (have some ideas ?)

* make results clearer

* make a webservice maybe ?

# Performance

The idea is to keep good performance when dealing with high amount of data.
